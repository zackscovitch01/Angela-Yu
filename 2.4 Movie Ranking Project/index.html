<h3>Uncharted</h3>
<p>
    Treasure hunter Victor "Sully" Sullivan recruits street-smart Nathan Drake to 
    help him recover a 500-year-old lost fortune amassed by explorer Ferdinand Magellan. 
    What starts out as a heist soon becomes a globe-trotting, white-knuckle race to reach 
    the prize before the ruthless Santiago Moncada can get his hands on it. 
    If Sully and Nate can decipher the clues and solve one of the world's oldest mysteries,
    they stand to find $5 billion in treasure -- but only if they can learn to work together.

<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>

    test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. 
    Training a detachment of graduates for a special assignment, 
    Maverick must confront the ghosts of his past and his deepest fears, 
    culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice 
    from those who choose to fly it.
